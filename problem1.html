     <p>
         Occupying a substantial bluff rising from the Mississippi River, the site of Memphis has been a natural location for human settlement by varying cultures over thousands of years.[11]
         The area was known to be settled in the first millennium A.D. by people of the Mississippian Culture, who had a network of communities throughout the Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries.
         They built complexes with large earthwork ceremonial and burial mounds as expressions of their sophisticated culture.[12]
         The historic Chickasaw Indian tribe, believed to be their descendants, later occupied the site.[13]
